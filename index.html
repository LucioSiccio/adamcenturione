            <p>
            My name is Adam Centurione. I am in my second year of Network Engineering and Security Analysis at Mohawk College (NESA). Previously I completed an Honors
                Bachelor of Science in Ecological Restoration, with a thesis in watershed biogeochemical analysis. I enjoy studing complex systems and doing data analysis,
                and bayesian inference. I am currently working on an internship with the Active Inference Institute. My career goals include working in ethical hacking, and developing
                active inference cybersecurity solutions. I am passionate about the history of banking and global finance, ecological systems and sustainability, Jaynesian probability theory
                and mathematics, and network administration!
